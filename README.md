# WhatsApp-Bot
This project implements a WhatsApp bot using Python, allowing users to automate message sending, receive commands, and respond accordingly. The bot uses the pywhatkit library for sending WhatsApp messages at specified times and the speech_recognition library for voice command recognition.
